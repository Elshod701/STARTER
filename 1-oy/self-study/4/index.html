        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a
            9x13 inch baking dish.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a large bowl, cream together the sugar and eggs until light and
            fluffy. Beat in the vanilla extract.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients alternately with the
            milk, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Stir in the oil
            until just combined.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pour batter into prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with sparkling
            sugar.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake in preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick
            inserted into the center comes out clean.
          </li>
          <li>Let cool completely before serving.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For a more intense flavor, use a good quality vanilla extract.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you don't have sparkling sugar, you can use regular granulated
            sugar. Just add a pinch of salt to the sugar before sprinkling it on
            top of the cake.
          </li>
          <li>
            This cake is best served warm, but it can also be served at room
            temperature.
          </li>
        </ul>
